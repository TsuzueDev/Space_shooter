Hello, I'm ending my first year as an Epitech student, this project is currently on development, so I will update it regularly.

The goal of this work is to learn c++ and graphical project.

The aim of this is to make a complete rogue-like in space with various enemy/buff/bosses.

How to run it
-------------
 `git clone` && enter the directory, then simply `make` and `./shooter`
